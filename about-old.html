  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>The Mega Store is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Our Leadership Principles</h2>
  <p>Our Leadership Principles aren't inspirational wall hangings. These Principles work hard, just like we do. We use them, every day, whether they're discussing ideas for new projects, deciding on the best solution for a customer's problem, or interviewing candidates.</p>
  <h2>Invent and Simplify</h2>
  <p>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>
  <h2>Hire and Develop the Best</h2>
  <p>Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.</p>
  <h2>Think Big</h2>
  <p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Building the future</h2>
  <p>We strive to have a positive impact on customers, employees, small businesses, the economy, and communities. We are smart, passionate builders with different backgrounds and goals, who share a common desire to always be learning and inventing on behalf of our customers.</p>
